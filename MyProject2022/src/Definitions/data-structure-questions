why do we need data structure?
    **** We need to store multiple data type.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
    **** Add, retrieve, remove, create, search, insert.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    **** 1.Compiler Design· 2.Operating System· 3.Database Management System· 4.Statistical analysis package,
         5.Numerical Analysis· 6.Graphics· 7.Artificial Intelligence...

what is an Array?
    **** Array is an object that holds multiple values.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    **** An array is a fixed-length data structure ( Take Length).
         ArrayList is a variable-length data structure ( Take Size ).

what is LinkedList?
    **** its a list that used nodes in order to store data.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
    **** Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.
         Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored

what is queue?
    **** Is a collection that uses FIFO to store and retrieve data.

what is stack?
    **** Is a collection that uses FILO to store and retrieve data

what is FIFO and LIFO?
    **** First in first out.
         Last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
    **** Big O notation

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
    **** The best case complexity is O(1) when element is first or last element in the array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
    **** Using an array list

what is tree in data structure?
    **** A non-linear data structure where each element is linked to two child element

what is graph in data structure?
    **** A non-linear data structure where one element can be linked to multiple elements

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    **** HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas
         Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    **** RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
         Network data model = Graph
         Hierarchical data model = Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
    **** Stores elements in form of key-value pair.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    **** When we access an array, or a Collection, that is backed by an array with an invalid index.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

    **** You can use a for loop and copy elements of one to another one by one.
         Use the clone method to clone an array.
         Use arraycopy() method of System class.
         Use copyOf() or copyOfRange() methods of Arrays class.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    **** An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
         A linked list is the collection of nodes that are randomly stored

What is DFS and BFS?
    **** BFS stands for Breadth First Search. DFS stands for Depth First Search.

What is Recursion?
    **** Recursion is the technique of making a function (method) call itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
    **** Linear: array list, linked list, set, map. Queue, stack.
         Non-linear: tree and graph

What is Big-(O)-notation?
    **** Big O Notation is a way to measure an algorithm's efficiency.
         It measures the time it takes to run your function as the input grows

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
